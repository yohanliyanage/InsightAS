InsightAS allows you to easily monitor and manage your application servers via a Web Console, which is integrated with various other facilities such as notifications via email, twitter, etc.

With InsightAS, you don't have to manually monitor your production servers anymore. InsightAS will alert you whenever your servers need your attention. Also, it gives a single console view of many important attributes of your servers, inlcuding JVM specific statistics such as Heap Allocation, Thread Utilization and also O/S specific statistics such as CPU utlization, RAM utilization and diskspace etc. 

InsightAS consists of a modular, extensible architecture which allows it to be easily extended to support various different application servers. Also, you can easily extend InisghtAS with your own senors to feed-in information, and also have customize alert levels.
